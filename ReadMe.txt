I did a design exercise and decided to replicate the homepage of a random website! 

I choose https://www.hublot.com website. Their homepage design is awesome! While I was not able to fully replicate the dynamic capabilites of their homepage, (at the time my skill was lacking javascript mastery ;p) but I think I did a good job getting the basic look of it.

Disclamer: The assets and design of this site is not owned by me but by hublot 100%. I just decided to replicate it for good fun and practice.

I had fun working on this exercise!
